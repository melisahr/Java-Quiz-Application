# Overview:
This is a simple multiple choice quiz that was created by following along to 
a YouTube video. The user must first enter a name and click on
the Rules button to enter. After reading the rules, the user can click the Start button 
to begin. Each question has a timer of 15 seconds before moving to the next. It has a 
50-50 lifeline button to narrow down the answers. After the quiz is completed,
the user can submit to receive a score. However, the quiz doesn't restart the questions
when the user tries to play again.
